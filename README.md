# Knowledge Distillation for Resource-efficient Graph Neural Networks

This repository provides resources on Graph Neural Network efficiency and scalability, as well as implementations of knowledge distillation techniques for developing resource-efficient GNNs.

Check out the accompanying paper ['On Representation Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04964), which introduces new GNN distillation techniques using contrastive learning to preserve the global topology of teacher and student embeddings.

‚ùìNew to GNN scalability: See [`awesome-efficient-gnns.md`](awesome-efficient-gnns.md) and the [accompanying blogpost](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/efficient-gnns/) for a currated overview of papers on efficient and scalable Graph Representation Learning for real-world applications.

## Distillation Techniques

![Representation distillation techniques for GNNs](img/techniques.png)

We benchmark the following knowledge distillation techniques for GNNs:
- **Local Structure Preserving loss**, [Yang et al., CVPR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10477): preserve pairwise relationships over graph edges, but may not preserve global topology due to latent interactions. 
- **Global Structure Preserving loss**, [Joshi et al., TNNLS 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04964): preserve all pairwise global relationships, but computationally more cumbersome.
- üåü **Graph Contrastive Representation Distillation**, [Joshi et al., TNNLS 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04964): contrastive learning among positive/negative pairwise relations across the teacher and student embedding spaces.

We also include baselines: **Logit-based KD**, [Hinton et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531); and feature mimicking baselines for computer vision: **FitNet**, [Romero et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6550), **Attention Transfer**, [Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03928).

## Datasets and Architectures

We conduct benchmarks on large-scale and real-world graph datasets, where the performance gap between expressive+cumbersome teacher and resource-efficient student GNNs is non-negligible:
- **Graph classification** on `MOLHIV` from Open Graph Benchmark/MoleculeNet -- GIN-E/PNA teachers, GCN/GIN students.
- **Node classification** on `ARXIV` and `MAG` from Open Graph Benchmark and Microsoft Academic Graph -- GAT/R-GCN teachers, GCN/GraphSage/SIGN students.
- **3D point cloud segmentation** on `S3DIS` -- not released publicly yet.
- **Node classification** on `PPI` -- provided to reproduce results from [Yang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10477)

## Installation and Usage

Our results are reported with Python 3.7, PyTorch, 1.7.1, and CUDA 11.0.
We used the following GPUs: RTX3090 for ARXIV/MAG, V100 for MOLHIV/S3DIS.

Usage instructions for each dataset are provided within the corresponding directory.
